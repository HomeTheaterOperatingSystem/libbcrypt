This library is a simple wrapper providing a convenient reentrant interface for
the bcrypt password hashing algorithm implementation as provided by Solar
Designer at http://www.openwall.com/crypt/. An exact copy of that source code
is included in the crypt_blowfish subdirectory. The library should build and
work in Linux and OpenBSD.

The provided C interface is inspired in the bcrypt Python module that can be
found at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bcrypt/, and consists of a function to
generate salts with the characteristic work factor parameter, one to generate
password hashes (which can also be used to verify passwords) and one designed
specifically to verify passwords and avoid timing attacks.

Additional functions are provided to pre-hash passwords with SHA-512 and
SHA3-512, which is a common approach to avoid the 72-character limit of the
bcrypt implementation.

Please check the header bcrypt.h and the generated manpage. Both mention the
prototypes, describe what they do and include examples.

The INSTALL file explains how to build and install the library from its source
code and lists the requirements for doing so.

All this code is released to the public domain under the terms of CC0. See the
COPYING file for the legal text.
