Installing from source requires asciidoc (for a2x), probably DocBook
stylesheets, GNU Make and GCC or a compatible compiler. make is usually GNU Make
in destkop Linux distributions, but you may have to call it as gmake in other
systems. Quick guide:

make
make test
make install # Usually as root.

When running make, you can set values for several variables to modify
compilation, installation and meta-information paths. If you do, you need to
include them in every call to make. This is important.

Variables:

* CC to set the C compiler.
* DESTDIR for a base installation path, empty by default.
* PREFIX, which is /usr/local by default.
* MANDIR, which is $(PREFIX)/share/man by default.
* INCLUDEDIR, which is $(PREFIX)/include by default.
* LIBDIR, which is $(PREFIX)/lib or $(PREFIX/lib64 by default.

You could also set CFLAGS but, by default, the ones provided by Solar Designer
at crypt_blowfish/Makefile are used. Personally, I recommend to keep them as
they are.
